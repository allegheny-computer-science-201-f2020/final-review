# CMPSC 201 Final Information

## Introduction

The exam will be released by 9:30am on Thursday, 3 December via GitHub. It will be due by midnight on the 7th of December 2020\. Following the process for lab assignments, you will be given a GitHub Classroom assignment link, you can then accept the assignment, clone the `final` repository, and find `final.md` file, which will contain the exam questions. You are invited to type your answers directly in this Markdown file. Continuous Integration will not be used in this repository. You should commit and push your work frequently. The last commit before the due time of midnight on December 7 will be graded.

The exam is open notes (hand written, typed, slides, programs, terminal, book). You are to abide by the college's Honor Code policy and the course's Code of Conduct while working on the exam. The answers will be checked for signs of plagiarism from the Internet.

Questions will be aimed at basic understanding of concepts and the ability to apply them in concrete examples.

Question types will include:

- Short answer (may require analysis of a given code) - the majority of the questions.
- Multiple choice and True/false - a small minority of questions.

You will not be asked to write code; however, you may be given snippets of code for analysis in languages you have been exposed to during labs, class sessions and class activities.
